    <p>Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish cherished for its hearty and comforting layers. It begins with sheets of tender pasta, which are delicately stacked alongside a robust tomato sauce infused with aromatic herbs and often savory ground meat, like beef or sausage. The addition of creamy ricotta or béchamel sauce adds richness, balancing the bold flavors of the meat and tomatoes. Each layer combines to create a medley of textures and tastes that is both satisfying and indulgent.</p>
    <p>On top, melted mozzarella and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese form a golden, bubbly crust that adds the perfect finishing touch. Whether prepared traditionally or with variations like spinach, mushrooms, or other vegetables, lasagna represents warmth and home-cooked love. Its versatility and ability to feed a crowd make it a staple at family gatherings and celebrations worldwide.</p>
