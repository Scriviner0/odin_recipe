    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
     <p>Pasta is a versatile and beloved staple of Italian cuisine that has won hearts worldwide. It is made primarily from a simple dough of wheat flour and water, often enriched with eggs for added flavor and texture. The dough is shaped into various forms, ranging from long strands like spaghetti to intricate shapes like fusilli or stuffed varieties like ravioli.
        The beauty of pasta lies in its ability to adapt to countless culinary creations. It serves as the perfect canvas for a wide array of sauces, from rich and creamy Alfredo to robust and tangy marinara. It can be baked into comforting casseroles like lasagna or tossed in a light olive oil and garlic dressing for a fresh, minimalist meal.</p>
