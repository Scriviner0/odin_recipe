    <h3>Descriptons</h3>
     <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic mixed rice dish that holds a cherished place in the culinary traditions of South Asia and beyond. Rooted in history, this dish is a harmonious blend of fragrant basmati rice, tender meat (like chicken, mutton, or seafood), or vegetables, infused with a medley of spices. These often include saffron, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and star anise, which contribute to its signature aroma and taste.</p>
     <p>Biryani typically features layers of rice and a richly spiced meat or vegetable mixture, often cooked with yogurt, tomatoes, fried onions, and fresh herbs like coriander and mint. The dish is then slow-cooked, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully. Some regional varieties add additional elements like dried fruits, nuts, or boiled eggs for extra texture and flavor</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and soak basmati rice for about 30 minutes, then cook it until it's 70-80% done. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Marinate your choice of meat (chicken, mutton, seafood) with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Let it rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Fry sliced onions in oil or ghee until golden brown. Reserve some for garnishing.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or pan, heat oil or ghee and sauté whole spices (cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, star anise) until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Add marinated meat and cook until tender, allowing the flavors to meld with the spices. For vegetarian biryani, sauté vegetables instead.</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat or vegetable mixture in the pot. Sprinkle fried onions, fresh coriander, mint leaves, and optional saffron soaked in warm milk over the rice.</li>
        <li>Seal the pot with a lid or dough to trap the steam, and cook on a low flame ("dum" style) for 20-30 minutes to let the flavors infuse fully.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani to mix the layers slightly without breaking the rice.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with raita, pickles, or boiled eggs for a complete and flavorful meal.</li>
    </ol>
